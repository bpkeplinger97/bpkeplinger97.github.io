    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <hr size="1" width="85%">
    <p> I am a Computer Science and Chinese Double Degree at the
      University of Maryland, College Park with an Associates Degree in
      Engineering. My interests lie in the realm of Machine Learning and AI,
      and their applications to security and human psychology. </p>
    <p> Currently, I work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the
      University of Maryland, in the Hybrid-Systems Integration and Simulation
      Lab (HSIS) along with being an IT Technician for the Adele H. Stamp
      Student Union. </p>
    <p> My background is primarily in Java, Python, and C, with work in
    Ocaml, Ruby, and Rust (Which I believe to be the next big thing in Computer
    Science). </p>
